# Generative UI Schema

## Purpose

This schema is designed to be generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) and used to dynamically render UI components within an application. It provides a structured way for an LLM to define a user interface that can then be parsed and displayed.

## Schema Overview

The root of the schema is an object that must contain a `ui_elements` array. Each item in this array represents a UI component that will be rendered.

A UI component can be one of two main types:

*   **`Atom`**: A fundamental, individual UI element (e.g., a button, a label, an input field).
*   **`Layout`**: A container that arranges other UI components (currently, only a "grid" layout is supported).

## Defining Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of the UI. They are defined as objects with the following properties:

*   **`type`** (string, required): This property specifies the kind of atom to be rendered.
    The available atom types are:
    *   `accordion`
    *   `avatar`
    *   `calendar`
    *   `checkbox`
    *   `collapsible`
    *   `context_menu`
    *   `dialog`
    *   `dropdown_menu`
    *   `hover_card`
    *   `label`
    *   `menubar`
    *   `portal`
    *   `progress`
    *   `radio_group`
    *   `scroll_area`
    *   `select`
    *   `separator`
    *   `slider`
    *   `switch`
    *   `tabs`
    *   `toast`
    *   `toggle`
    *   `toggle_group`
    *   `toolbar`
    *   `tooltip`

*   **`properties`** (object, required): This object contains key-value pairs specific to the atom's `type`. These properties define the atom's appearance, behavior, and content.
    For example, a `label` atom might have a `text` property:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "label",
      "properties": {
        "text": "Hello, World!"
      }
    }
    ```

## Defining Layouts

Layouts are used to arrange multiple UI components. Currently, the only supported layout type is "grid".

*   **`layout_type`** (string, required): Must be set to `"grid"` for the current version.
*   **`rows`** (integer, required): Defines the number of rows in the grid. Must be at least 1.
*   **`cols`** (integer, required): Defines the number of columns in the grid. Must be at least 1.
*   **`elements`** (array, required): An array of `LayoutElement` objects that will be placed within the grid.
*   **`gap`** (integer, optional): Defines the space (in abstract units or pixels, depending on interpretation) between grid cells. Minimum 0.
*   **`padding`** (integer, optional): Defines the padding (in abstract units or pixels) around the grid. Minimum 0.

Each `LayoutElement` object within the `elements` array defines an atom and its position within the grid:

*   **`atom`** (Atom, required): The Atom object to be placed in the grid cell.
*   **`row`** (integer, required): The row number (1-indexed) where the atom should be placed.
*   **`col`** (integer, required): The column number (1-indexed) where the atom should be placed.
*   **`row_span`** (integer, optional, default: 1): The number of rows the atom should span.
*   **`col_span`** (integer, optional, default: 1): The number of columns the atom should span.

## Example

Here's an example demonstrating a standalone atom and a grid layout:

```json
{
  "ui_elements": [
    {
      "type": "label",
      "properties": {
        "text": "Welcome to Our Application!"
      }
    },
    {
      "layout_type": "grid",
      "rows": 2,
      "cols": 2,
      "gap": 10,
      "padding": 15,
      "elements": [
        {
          "atom": {
            "type": "avatar",
            "properties": {
              "imageUrl": "path/to/image.png",
              "altText": "User Avatar"
            }
          },
          "row": 1,
          "col": 1
        },
        {
          "atom": {
            "type": "label",
            "properties": {
              "text": "Click Me Button Below"
            }
          },
          "row": 1,
          "col": 2
        },
        {
          "atom": {
            "type": "toggle",
            "properties": {
              "label": "Enable Feature"
            }
          },
          "row": 2,
          "col": 1,
          "col_span": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

*(Note: The example provided in the prompt used a "button" atom type which is not in the defined schema. I've replaced it with "label" and "toggle" atoms from the available list for accuracy. Also, the prompt's example for `gap` and `padding` used string values like "10px", but the schema defines them as integers. I've adjusted the example to use integer values for `gap` and `padding`.)*

## Extensibility

The schema is designed with extensibility in mind. Future versions may include:

*   New atom types.
*   Additional layout types beyond the current grid system.
*   More sophisticated properties for existing atoms and layouts.

## Schema File

The definitive source for this schema is the `generative_ui_schema.json` file located in this directory.
