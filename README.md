## Capabilities

These are atomic modules that power and connect systems via LLMs, data, and UI logic.

| Capability | Alias | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Pulse** | `pulse` | Context-aware nudge engine for proactive suggestions |
| **Morph** | `morph` | Generative UI renderer based on real-time intent |
| **Neuro** | `neuro` | Dynamic context graph of thoughts, tasks, and relationships |
| **Drift** | `drift` | Passive capture of thoughts, insights, and ambient signals |
| **Vox** | `vox` | Multimodal voice interface with speech input and AI feedback |
| **Node** | `node` | Modular plugin system for injecting or extending any system |
| **Mask** | `mask` | Dynamic assistant persona customization engine |
| **Sigil** | `sigil` | Progress tracker that mints achievements and reputation as digital artifacts |

---

## Development Guidelines

Each system is a self-contained domain that pulls capabilities as composable utilities. Systems and capabilities are versioned and independently deployable.

- Systems live in `/systems/[system-name]`
- Capabilities live in `/capabilities/[capability-name]`
- System config maps define which capabilities are activated
- Use TypeScript + modular exports with context and state hooks
