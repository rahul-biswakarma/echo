## Development

Your new bare-bones project includes minimal organization with a single `main.rs` file and a few assets.

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ assets/ # Any assets that are used by the app should be placed here
‚îú‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ main.rs # main.rs is the entry point to your application and currently contains all components for the app
‚îú‚îÄ Cargo.toml # The Cargo.toml file defines the dependencies and feature flags for your project
```

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
